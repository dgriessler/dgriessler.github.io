     <h1>Summary</h1>
     <p>
          Proposes a sample weighting approach called DenseWeight which they include into a cost-sensitive learning appraoch called DenseLoss. These are meant to be used with imbalanced regression datasets.
          DenseWeight uses the distribution of the training example to weight rare training data higher in the loss function than the more common training data.
          In a nutshell, "they compute a kernel density estimation (KDE) that approximates the target value distribution, calculate a weighting function from the resulting probability density function, and 
          weight the loss for each data point in the training procedure."
     </p>
     <p>
          DenseWeight is based on 5 properties:
     </p>
     <ol>
          <li>Samples with common values are weighted less than rarer samples</li>
          <li>The hyperparameter alpha when set to 0 has no effect and as alpha increases the weighting is applied more and more.</li>
          <li>No weights are negative</li>
          <li>No weight is 0</li>
          <li>The mean weight over all points is 1.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>
          DenseLoss simply multiplies the weight of a sample provided by DenseWeight by the meter M used in the loss function. Their results mainly show a reduction in error on rarer samples with only a slight
          increase in error on the common samples.
     </p>
     <p>
          Results show great results on pareto which matches the distribution of our dataset.
