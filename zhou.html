     <h1>Summary</h1>
     <p>
          This paper introduces an approach of learning the representation and classifer together based on the same weights but use two different branches
          to supply examples. The conventional learning branch is the typical long-tail distribution with uniform sampling. The re-balancing branch is a
          reversed sampler. These are combined together in the cumulative learning block where some hyper parameter alpha is varied such that in the beginning 
          the examples from the conventional branch are used and as epochs go by they are used less and less as the re-balancing branch examples are used. Their
          cumulative learning strategy is outlined in more detail but alpha depends on the epoch number and the maximum epoch number to be calculated. Their results
          show great success.
