     <h1>Summary</h1>
     <p>
          Thomas has two main contributions. Thomas offers an improved dataset for CME and other solar weather features to corresponding SEP intensity and threshold
          and peak time, and several neural network architectures to predict SEP peak intensity, threshold time and peak time.
     </p>
     <p>
          The first problem was predicting the peak intensity of 10 MeV proton events using CME characteristics. Baseline features from the CME and DONKI catalog
          were combined with derived features to form 20 features. Approaches included neural networks with oversampling, rRT with Autoencoder, and adaptive calibration.
          Evaluation metrics included mean absolute error (MAE), pearson correlation (PCC), F1, TSS, and HSS. Data was paritioned randomly and chronologically. Random
          paritiooning performed better than chronological partitioning. The best approach was rRT+AE for MAE and TSS with oversampling rate of 40-0%, but the best
          F1-score was achieved using adaptive-calibration and oversampling of 40-30% and 50-0%. However, when maximizing true detections, oversampling of 20-20%
          with rRT+AE model is best with a tradeoff of the number of false-negatives.
     </p>
     <p>
          The second problem was predicting the threshold and peak time. The features used in the first problem were reused in addition to a feature: connection angle.
          Approaches included random-oversampling, rRT+AE, and Adaptive Calibration. The same MAE and PCC metrics were used. To compare threshold time and peak time,
          Thomas used PCC and ratio of MAE with standard deviation of the observed value. The rRT+AE consistently had the best results.
