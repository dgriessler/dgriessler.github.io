     <h1>Summary</h1>
     <p>Presents a model for predicting SEP event-integrated and peak intensity spectra between 10 and 130 MeV at 1 Au based on STEREO, GOES, and PAMELA satellite experiement. SEP
     intensities are reconstrcted from 32 SEP events between 2010 and 2014 using a 2D Gaussian functional form which is energy dependent and accounting for the correctional between
     the intensity and speed of the CME and magnetic field-line connection angle. The CME measurements are from DONKI. The model is tested using 20 SEP events not used to derive the formula.
     The observed and predicted event-integrated and peak intensities at Earth and at the STEREO spacecraft agree in spectral shape and absolute value.</p>

          The formula referenced is the same one as mentioned in
          <a href="./richardson.html">Prediction of Solar Energetic Particle Event Peak Proton Intensity Using a Simple Algorithm Based on CME Speed and Direction and Observations of Associated Solar Phenomena</a>.
          There is some intensive math in the section for SEP Intensity Spatial Distribution. Results are produced for peak and event-integrated intensity as a function of longitudinal connection angle. These
          form Gaussian curves with a center often around 43 degrees. CME speed is shown to have a linear correlation with the intensity values between 10 and 130 MeV in both event integrated and peak. Their
          formula allows them to plot a band of prediction for 10-130 MeV instead of just a singular value as predicted in 14-24 MeV peak intensities by the referenced formula.
