     <h1>Summary</h1>
     <p>
          Solar energetic particles (SEPs) can cause severe damage to people and to equipment. Two tasks were accomplished: predicting their occurence
          using a combination of observed CME properties and derived features and forecasting their intensity using electron and proton flux time
          series data. When predicting intensity, the data was separated into ranges and used to train separate models with the correct model 
          either manually selected or predicted using another model.
     </p>
     <p>
          One contribution was deriving features from the initial set of features when prediciting the occurence of SEP events. Another was presenting
          a method for calculating feature importance within the feed-forward network trained when doing the same prediction. In the second problem of
          predicing intensity, the contribution was separating data into intensity ranges and using that to train multiple models to address the imbalance
          between SEP events from the background noise.
     </p>
     <p>
          Features for the predicting SEP occurence included linear speed, width, acceleration, 2nd order speed initial, 2nd order speed final, 2nd order speed 
          at 20 solar radii, Central position angle (CPA), and Measurement position angle (MPA). Derived features included the number of CMEs in the past month,
          the number of CMEs in the past 9 hours, the maximum speed of all CMEs in the past day, and the number of CMEs in the past 9 hours with a speed greater
          than 1000 km/s. The outside features used included V * log(V), where V is the linear speed; whether or not the CME is a Halo (CPA = 360 degrees), and
          a formula to replace V^V^2. Futher added and derived features from other sources included sunspot number at the time of a CME, area of visualization of
          a Type II burst occuring during the CME, and the formula for predicting peak 14- to 24-MeV proton intensity.
     </p>
     <p>
          The NN for predicting SEP occurence was a multilayer perceptron NN with a single output sigmoid unit. Feature importance was calculated using matrix
          multiplication with matrices formed from the weights. Feature importance is quantfied then in relation to other features. Missing data was replaced 
          using oversampling which duplicates the minority cases of a rare SEP event occuring until it's a better ratio with the majority cases of no SEP event
          occuring. Evaluation was done through a confusion matrix (True Negative, False Negative, False Positive, True Positive). From there, recall = TP/(TP + FN),
          FPR = FP/(FP + TN), precision = TP/(TP + FP), and PFA = FP/(TP+FP) can be calculated as can TSS = TP/(TP+FN) - FP/(FP+TN) and F1 = (2*precision*recall) / (precision + recall).
          TSS turned out to not be a very useful measurement but F1 was much more valuable. In addition, adding more features lead to higher F12 score. The threshold
          for the output sigmoid unit was varied and the best threshold was 0.962. All features were of somewhat importance when using their formula for calculating
          feature importance with none magnitudes better than the others. 
     </p>
     <p>
          Predicting intensity does not use CMEs but predicts a continuous value based on continuous past values. The prediction is made 30 minutes or 1 hour from 
          the current time. Electron and proton intensities are used as features with additional phases added to the input and later x-ray related features added in.
          A baseline is established using a single NN on the whole dataset. The imbalance between background noise and SEP events was resolved using multiple models.
          One multiple model system was based on models based on intensity with a high, medium, and low intensity model selected based on thresholds. The other was
          based on if the data was classified as rising, falling, or background. The evaluation included mean aboluste error, lag between onset and peak, lag 
          between onset and threshold, and time difference to reach ln(10) vs predictions reaching ln(10), the threshold for SEP classification. Data was split
          into training and test sets.
